# FlatSyle

Once a popular package of free components for Delphi, now probably completely forgotten.

The author of the package is Maik Porkert. His website (`flatstyle.de`) was last operational in 2001: https://web.archive.org/web/20010405202740/http://www.flatstyle.de/download_fs.html

Currently, the package can be downloaded from:
